# Task 8 - K-Means Clustering (Customer Segmentation)

This notebook is part of the AI & ML Internship tasks.

##  Dataset
**Mall_Customers.csv**  
Used for customer segmentation based on:
- Annual Income (k$)
- Spending Score (1-100)

##  What I Did
- Loaded the dataset
- Visualized the income vs spending behavior
- Used the **Elbow Method** to find the best number of clusters (K)
- Applied **KMeans clustering**
- Visualized the customer segments with different colors
- Evaluated performance using **Silhouette Score**

##  Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

##  Output
The notebook shows how customers can be grouped into 5 distinct clusters using their spending behavior and income level.

##  Learnings
- Unsupervised learning with KMeans
- Choosing optimal K using the elbow method
- Evaluating clusters with silhouette score
